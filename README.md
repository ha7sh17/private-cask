Respect for developers

# Introduce
My personal whiskey aging began with the purchase of a 5-liter cask made of Yeongdong oak. This whiskey aged alongside me as I worked from home as a developer. The oak barrel would have breathed and allowed the whiskey to evaporate into the air, and I believe the angel‘s share played a role in keeping me sharp and productive as a developer. I dedicate this whiskey to all the developers who work tirelessly to develop their skills, even if it means developing a ”turtle neck“ from sitting at their desks for extended periods of time.
